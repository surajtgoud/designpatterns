Exploring Javascript designpatterns

History of Design Pattern
Since its inception, the concept of design pattern has been around in the programming world. But it was not formalized till 1994 when one of the most influential work was published called “Design Patterns: Elements Of Reusable Object-Oriented Software” – written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides – a group that became known as the Gang of Four (or GoF).

In this book, 23 object-oriented design patterns are featured. Since then, the “pattern approach” became popular in the software engineering industry, and after that, dozens of other patterns have been discovered.

Categories of Design Pattern
Based on intent, the JavaScript design patterns can be categorized into 3 major groups:

a) Creational Design Pattern

These patterns focus on handling object creation mechanisms. A basic object creation approach in a program can lead to an added complexity. Creational JS design patterns aim to solve this problem by controlling the creation process.

Few patterns that fall under this category are – Constructor, Factory, Prototype, Singleton, etc.

b) Structural Design Patterns

These patterns are concerned with object composition. They explain simple ways to assemble objects and classes into larger structures. They help ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure of the system doesn’t need to do the same, keeping them flexible and efficient.

Few patterns that fall under this category are – Module, Decorator, Facade, Adapter, Proxy, etc.

c) Behavioral Design Patterns

These patterns focus on improving the communication and assignment of responsibilities between dissimilar objects in a system.

Few patterns that fall under this category are – Chain of Responsibility, Command, Observer, Iterator, Strategy, Template, etc.
