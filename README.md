History of Design Pattern
Since its inception, the concept of design pattern has been around in the programming world. But it was not formalized till 1994 when one of the most influential work was published called “Design Patterns: Elements Of Reusable Object-Oriented Software” – written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides – a group that became known as the Gang of Four (or GoF).

In this book, 23 object-oriented design patterns are featured. Since then, the “pattern approach” became popular in the software engineering industry, and after that, dozens of other patterns have been discovered.
